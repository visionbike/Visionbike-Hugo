I am Phuc Thanh-Thien Nguyen (Felix Nguyen), current working as Ph.D Candidate at Autonomous and Soft Robotics (ASR)Laboratory National Taiwan University, Taiwan. My focus lies with computer vision, digital signal processing, machine learning and deep learning in various applications. I have experienced with applications such as bio-signal, semantic segmentation and object detection.

## Welcome to my blog!
In this blog, I will post small yet interesting notes of knowledge as well as state-of-the-art AI innovation, that I have found during my work as a researcher.

I have done research on convolutional neural networks for computer-aided diagnosis and biosignal processing for various applications. In my current work, I am applying machine learning (supervised & unsupervised) and statistics to business problems. My go-to programming language is Python with the common data science and machine learning stack.
