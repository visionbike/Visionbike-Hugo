I am Phuc Thanh-Thien Nguyen (Felix Nguyen), current working as Ph.D Candidate at Autonomous and Soft Robotics (ASR) Laboratory, National Taiwan University, Taiwan. I focus on computer vision, digital signal processing, machine learning and deep learning in various applications, such as bio-signal, semantic segmentation and object detection.

## Welcome to my blog!
In this blog, I will post small yet interesting notes of knowledge as well as state-of-the-art AI innovation, that I have found during my work as a researcher.

I have done research on convolutional neural networks for computer-aided diagnosis and biosignal processing for various applications. In my current work, I am applying machine learning (supervised & unsupervised) and statistics to business problems. My go-to programming language is Python with the common data science and machine learning stack.
